    <h1 class="circle">Coca Cola</h1>

    <p class="first-paragraph">
        On May 8, 1886, Dr. John Pemberton served the first Coca-Cola in the world at Jacobs' Pharmacy in Atlanta, Ga.
        From that one iconic drink, we have evolved into a total beverage company.
        <br />
        More than 1.9 billion servings of our drinks are enjoyed in more than 200 countries each day. And it is the
        700,000 individuals employed by The Coca-Cola Company and 225+ bottling partners that help to deliver
        refreshment across the globe.

        <h3 class="sub-heading">Our Vision:</h3>
        <p class="sub-paragraph">
            Our vision is to craft the brands and choice of drinks that people love, to refresh them in body & spirit.
            And done in ways that create a more sustainable business and better shared future that makes a difference in
            people's lives, communities and our planet.

    <h2 class="paragraph-heading-two">Creating a World Without Waste</h2>
    
    <p class="second-paragraph">
        The interconnected global challenges of packaging waste and climate change have made this a focus for our
        business and we are taking a hard look at the packaging we use and how we can drive change.
        We recognize our responsibility to help solve the global plastic waste crisis. World Without Waste, our
        ambitious sustainable packaging initiative, aims to create systemic change through a circular economy for our
        packaging alongside our bottling partners. The World Without Waste strategy has signaled a renewed focus on our
        entire packaging lifecycle—from how bottles and cans are designed and produced to how they're recycled and
        repurposed—through a focus on three fundamental areas: design, collect and partner.
